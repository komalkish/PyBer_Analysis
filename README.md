# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
The is an analysis performed on all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. 
## Project Overview
Using the Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I have create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I have created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Resources:
1. Data Source: city_data.csv & ride_data.csv
2. Software : Python 3.6.1, visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

# Results:
1. Total rides by city types : I noted that there are significantly higher riders in Urban in comparision to other city types. Total rides by city types:

# Summary:
Three business recommendations:
1. There are opportunities to increase riders count in Suburban and Rural
2. There are opportunities to increase driver count in Suburban and Rural thereby increasing total rider counts in both the city types.
3. Provide incentives to drivers in urban cities as the average fare per driver is less compared to other city types.
